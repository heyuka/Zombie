# Zombie

Have an IT department that knows how to set the screen lock time out through group policy but doesn't care to track any more than that? Zombie is for you. It's a simple Windows Forms application that will keep your computer from locking the screen by simulating a key press movement every 30 seconds. Not that I would recommend using it. That would probably be against company policy. And that would be bad.
